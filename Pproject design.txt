Cisco Packet Tracer File: Basic Campus Network Design

1. Components to Add:
    - 1 Router (e.g., Cisco 2811) for ISP connectivity.
    - 1 Layer 3 Switch (Core Switch).
    - 6 Layer 2 Switches (one for each department and office).
    - End devices: Desktops and laptops for each department.
    - Connection types:
        - Fiber optic for router to core switch connection.
        - Ethernet for core switch to department switches.
        - Ethernet for department switches to end devices.

2. Connections:
    - Router's GigabitEthernet0/0 connected to the Core Switch's first Gigabit port.
    - Core Switch's other ports connected to each Layer 2 switch.
    - PCs connected to the Layer 2 switches' FastEthernet ports.

3. Configurations:
    - Assign private IPs to departments using DHCP:
        - Admin Block: 192.168.1.0/24
        - Library: 192.168.2.0/24
        - Department 1: 192.168.3.0/24
        - Department 2: 192.168.4.0/24
        - Department 3: 192.168.5.0/24
        - Other Offices: 192.168.6.0/24

4. VLANs:
    - VLAN 10 for Admin, VLAN 20 for Library, VLAN 30 for each department, VLAN 40 for Offices.

5. QoS (Optional):
    - Configure QoS policies for fair bandwidth distribution.
